# Cyber-Canary
Capstone Project 
The Cyber Canary project improves these threat detection and response capabilities. Including deliberately insecure apps within containers. These containers are a useful tool for imitating actual attack scenarios. Producing logs in reaction to any activity occurring in the environment, they are subsequently routed via Syslog-ng to a centralized Virtual Machine (VM), safely collecting, processing, and classifying log messages.
This implementation demonstrates Cyber Canaryâ€™s effectiveness in providing timely alerts on potential security incidents, offering a practical and scalable approach for securing containerized applications. Integrating with Syslog-ng, it significantly enhances real-time threat detection, analysis, and response, fortifying security strategies against evolving cyber threats.

The system's lightweight construction and monitoring are non-intrusive, having little effect on container performance and enabling effective operation. This keeps the system responsive to rising alert loads and scalable. Cohesive event analysis is also made effective by centralized analysis, aggregating these warnings onto a single VM. By allowing for the distinction of warnings based on attack-type filters, this strategy not only improves the detection of complex attacks but also boosts the overall efficacy and efficiency of threat management.
